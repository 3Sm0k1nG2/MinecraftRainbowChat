# Requirements
You only require to be **op** and either have the *server console* or the server has to have *enabled command blocks* because the commands can be very long and the chat box will not be enough :)

# Tutorial
Open the program
Type your in-game username and hit *enter* (spaces are ignored so you can have as many as you want, they will be stripped out, as well as every character after the 32th)
Type the message you want to type and hit *enter* (For noy only ASCII is supported, so Cyrilic, Chinese and special symbols **will not** work!)
And you are <ins>done</ins>! The command will be *automatically* copied to your clipboard so you just have to press **Ctrl+V** in minecraft console or command block. If the command is not copied (example: you dont have enough memory) the command will be written out in the console)

# Download
You can download the program in the [Releases](https://github.com/xXTurnerLP/MinecraftRainbowChat/releases/) section
